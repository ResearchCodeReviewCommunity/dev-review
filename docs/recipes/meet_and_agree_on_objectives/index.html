<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<p>Set the code review up for success by making sure the reviewer and author are on the same page.</p>
<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>If they have some, reviewer(s) state their expectation for the code review.</li>
<li>If they have some, the code author state their expectation for the code review.</li>
<li>Author and reviewers agree on the focus of the review</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Code review can be a powerful tool to improve code quality… provided
that participants agree on what &ldquo;improve&rdquo; means. Should you focus on
code readability? Or performance? For a code review to be productive,
both the author and the reviewer(s) must agree on the direction to
follow.</p>
<p>During the startup meeting, all participants in the review state their
expectations and agree on what the objective of the review should be.
As the code author, you could plan to receive feedback on a particular
design choice you made last week.  Or maybe you&rsquo;re planning to pick
the reviewer&rsquo;s brain about optimising the performance of that sluggish
subroutine. As a reviewer, you could be motivated by learning new
features of a programming language. You could also want to put the
focus on readability, because you think there is room for improvement
in this direction. These expectations must be made clear during the
startup meeting, before the review itself starts.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, we recommend that the review focuses on one of the
following themes, ordered by priority:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code readability</li>
<li>Code maintainability</li>
<li>Code extensability</li>
<li>Performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Particularly, we do not recommend focusing on performance unless it is
justified from a scientific perspective. Optimising for performance
often makes code harder to read and maintain.</p>
<p>Another special case is a &ldquo;debugging session&rdquo;. The code author is looking
for help to fix a specific problem, and code quality may not be the primary
focus of the code review.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>R is familiar with the basics of C++, but never used it
frequently. They would like to learn what kind of features their C++
programmers colleagues use, and learn a few tricks along the way.  A
has been working on a C++ analysis pipeline on their own for the
past few weeks and is about to share it with their team. Before they
do so, they would like to check that the code is easy to read and
the structure easy to understand, even by colleagues with little
experience in C++. R and A decide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A is looking is unsure about a the design of a module their wrote
last week.  It works, but it is complicated and contains a lot of
duplicated code. They would like somebody else to assess
readability and potentially suggest alternative design choices.  R
is keen on helping a colleague improving their code, but doesn&rsquo;t
have specific expectations. they find the code easy to read although
they agree that the structure is odd.  A and R decide to have a look
at the module, looking to better define the issue, assess current
maintainability and, if time allows, draft a few solutions to
improve code structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A&rsquo;s numerical experiments are running much slower than
expected. They identified a specific function performing poorly, and
they&rsquo;re looking for help in investigating the root cause. R previously
had a look at the function and the surrounding code, but found it
very hard to read. R suggests that they focus on identifying what
makes the code difficult to read and, if time allows, think of some
options that would improve its structure. They agree that they could
look into performance in a follow up review, once the code is easier
to read.</p>
